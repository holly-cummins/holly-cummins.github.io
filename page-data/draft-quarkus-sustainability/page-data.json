For something like buying a car, there are hard choices.\nShould we get the muscley one with the bigger engine that goes vrrroooom, or should we get the economical one\nthat preserves fuel and goes put-put-put?</p>\n<p>“Performance is the art of avoiding work” - Stale Pederson\nThe car is faster because it uses more resources. Quarkus is faster because it’s more efficient.</p>\n<p>Of course, there’s always a trade-off. With Quarkus, there is a trade-off, but it’s not the tradeoff I expected.\nWhen running on JVM, Quarkus uses about half the memory footprint of a traditional cloud native framework, and starts about four times faster.</p>\n<p>Counter-intuitive.\nTANSTAAFL.\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_ain%27t_no_such_thing_as_a_free_lunch\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_ain%27t_no_such_thing_as_a_free_lunch</a></p>\n<p>“Finer-grained conditional builds”\nShorter, smarter, builds does seem like it would be such a massive win, doesn’t it? So much compute power is wasted on compiling things that didn’t change and then running tests that aren’t interesting … all while slowing down the feedback cycle for engineers.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/10/26/magazine/climate-change-warming-world.html?unlocked_article_code=nSFmgJkOOM86wP8afjvaX_PQjczJ2geMJRLbprE5vn9LA7umuI0cbtPUQrgDsufHwtq_uAtUZcKmtMlNyHB5iLIlI1s1KBYL7dUee266Dm-viXZSZkwOBBxCVWXQd6Y5U9oaV1AedzecR_Bg_dIdE_R7h6TKAMPmEfgU2wvT9BT689FF83ApOL-gX8kgnyjr6uuPIymwJsMPwTCaawnU_-6eIWu208mi-Whm9PViKp4MhKNToHPCvbgJZLhA-L1Nrg0VvtuPBwnwUI6cxh5SUzbZttxhcyHPH-Ayd9jSbnryf03Fqgce0YwK4ZC8eIm93xW8KmRFcOPQCboT4zji0ePIklmany6HtBT00fUmuBSPIGKPN8f8&#x26;smid=share-url\">https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/10/26/magazine/climate-change-warming-world.html?unlocked_article_code=nSFmgJkOOM86wP8afjvaX_PQjczJ2geMJRLbprE5vn9LA7umuI0cbtPUQrgDsufHwtq_uAtUZcKmtMlNyHB5iLIlI1s1KBYL7dUee266Dm-viXZSZkwOBBxCVWXQd6Y5U9oaV1AedzecR_Bg_dIdE_R7h6TKAMPmEfgU2wvT9BT689FF83ApOL-gX8kgnyjr6uuPIymwJsMPwTCaawnU_-6eIWu208mi-Whm9PViKp4MhKNToHPCvbgJZLhA-L1Nrg0VvtuPBwnwUI6cxh5SUzbZttxhcyHPH-Ayd9jSbnryf03Fqgce0YwK4ZC8eIm93xW8KmRFcOPQCboT4zji0ePIklmany6HtBT00fUmuBSPIGKPN8f8&#x26;smid=share-url</a></p>\n<p>[![“Yep.
