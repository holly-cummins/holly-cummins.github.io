Our applications have gotten bigger, more distributed, and more complicated, and there are whole new categories of mistakes we can make. Some things that were a good idea ten years ago turn out to be a terrible idea in the cloud; and what used to be ‘good enough’ for testing really isn’t anymore. Managing microservices architecture demands a lot of us, to ensure observability, operational resiliency, and organisational agility. With a focus on Java, this talk will introduce some of the new tools, patterns, and best practices for modern distributed application development. It also gives a tour of some of the most painful anti-patterns Holly has seen as a cloud consultant.</p>","excerpt":"The cloud is just someone else’s data center, but it has fundamentally changed how we design software and what we expect from our platforms…","fields":{"title":"Cloud Chaos and Microservices Mayhem","slug":"/cloud-chaos-and-microservices-mayhem-oop/","prefix":"2023-02-08","shortDate":"02-08","category":"cloud-native","author":"Holly Cummins","displayCategory":"cloud native","geography":null,"video":null,"slides":{"title":"Cloud Chaos and Microservices Mayhem - presented at OOP Digital","html":"<iframe id=\"talk_frame_987953\" class=\"speakerdeck-iframe\" src=\"//speakerdeck.com/player/754aa53970924841b20e611f09830314\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" style=\"aspect-ratio:800/450; border:0; padding:0; margin:0; background:transparent;\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>\n","url":"https://speakerdeck.com/hollycummins/cloud-chaos-and-microservices-mayhem-presented-at-oop-digital"},"oembeds":null,"cover":{"childImageSharp":{"resize":{"src":"/static/2be7da13d6fb7c0c63cda984c5c42eb4/9dc27/slide_0.jpg"}}}},"frontmatter":{"type":"talk","event":"OOP","keynote":null,"code":[{"title":"Demo code showing Pact contract testing on Quarkus","url":"https://github.com/holly-cummins/pact-quarkus-sweater-demo"}],"resources":null}},"authornote":{"id":"77e0dd69-1df1-59df-9a8e-f3f29c267627","html":"<p><strong>Holly Cummins</strong>.
