Automation killed the job of the washerwoman, and the stockinger, and also the knocker-up.\nBut wait, what on earth is a knocker-up?</p>\n<p>Do you remember alarm clocks? They were the things we used to use before we all used our phones as alarms.\nThey were mechanical, and are themselves a relatively recent invention.\nBefore people had alarms, how did they get to work at the right time?</p>\n<p>Often, “the right time’ was the time that they got to work. Cows and carrots and fields are pretty forgiving of tardiness.\nIt was only when people starting working together, in shifts, in expensive factories, that clock-time became important.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 800px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/89c6ef32242c53496c3293e0b43e0512/10c1e/knocker-up.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 55.99999999999999%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAALCAYAAAB/Ca1DAAAACXBIWXMAABYlAAAWJQFJUiTwAAAA70lEQVR42qWS3W6CQBCFef83shixkTRNKKxGVxa9aPlZoKyGtBJFEE7jNJrG9ELwXH0z2T2zMzsabtS2LWSSYH84XOMu0m4TTdNgODERxjHFoZTI8/xuc+2/5NAYg7susWU7ePf9xwyVUhCcEwvhwQ/CfobnC83pRCyjCGVZXsfQaYaXyn4kMeO/rTLG4C6XZFbXdT9DZ8HxYtvEg4EO/UkHnznYfX/1a/mVTWFaFvFoZMDzBPibiTSOuhleDso0BZvPicfGM5IkxWoxxSb77PfCqqpo585zU1mG8njEx1pgu1GPrc1fhUGAoiju/pQfguFZkeFas48AAAAASUVORK5CYII='); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"A person with a long stick, standing in front of a window\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/89c6ef32242c53496c3293e0b43e0512/5a190/knocker-up.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/89c6ef32242c53496c3293e0b43e0512/772e8/knocker-up.png 200w,\n/static/89c6ef32242c53496c3293e0b43e0512/e17e5/knocker-up.png 400w,\n/static/89c6ef32242c53496c3293e0b43e0512/5a190/knocker-up.png 800w,\n/static/89c6ef32242c53496c3293e0b43e0512/c1b63/knocker-up.png 1200w,\n/static/89c6ef32242c53496c3293e0b43e0512/29007/knocker-up.png 1600w,\n/static/89c6ef32242c53496c3293e0b43e0512/10c1e/knocker-up.png 2090w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>This new need for punctuality spawned a new job: the knocker-up.</p>\n<p>The knocker-up was a human alarm clock.\nKnockers-up would visit their clients and wake them up, either by tapping on the window with a stick, or by shooting their window with pea-shooters.</p>\n<p>(If you’re reading this and are confused or horrified, the important context you’re missing is that ‘knocking up’ means ‘to wake someone up’ in UK English.\nIn North American English ‘knocking up’ means ‘to impregnate’, but that kind of service was definitely outside the job description here.)</p>\n<p>Knocking-up was a job created by the changing technology of the industrial revolution, but changing technology also eliminated the profession.\nAs more people got mechanical alarm clocks, the need for the knocker-up faded.\nThe need didn’t fade as fast as you might think, though;\nprofessional knocking-up lasted to the 1940s and 1950s, and in some parts of England <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-35840393\">it hung around until the 1970s.</a></p>\n<p>Even though it survived a surprisingly long time, it’s easy to see why the knocking-up industry was ultimately doomed:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A convenient technological alternative was available</li>\n<li>The pool of the population who need waking up is limited; only people working outside the home on a strict schedule wanted the service</li>\n<li>Each client needed the service a maximum of once a day; no matter how much marketing a knocker-up did, no matter how great the knocking-up service, people didn’t need re-waking once they were already awake</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A cheap alternative, and finite demand. Clearly, knocking-up couldn’t last.</p>\n<h2>Why software development is different (really!)</h2>\n<p>So what’s different for developers? Almost everything.\nAlthough software-writing automation is (sort of) available, it is <em>not</em> a convenient replacement for human developers.\nThat’s true now, and it’s likely to stay true.\nCrucially, too, the world’s demand for software is apparently infinite, or would be if there weren’t budget constraints.\nThat means demand for software developers is large, and growing.</p>\n<h2>The role of the developer - writing code is only a small part</h2>\n<p>Why can’t Copilot, or ChatGPT, or Devin, or other generative AI equivalents, do the job of a software developer?\nThese tools are very, very, good at copying and pasting code from the internet.\nSoftware developers are also <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.blog/2021/09/28/become-a-better-coder-with-this-one-weird-click/\">very good</a> at copying and pasting code from the internet, but these tools are even better.</p>\n<p>But the job of a software developer is not to copy and paste from the internet.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 800px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/2c5b55e042e34974ddf25a5c8474d1eb/c3611/copy-paste.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 34%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAAHCAYAAAAIy204AAAACXBIWXMAABYlAAAWJQFJUiTwAAAAxElEQVR42p3QPw6CMBQGcM7GgAeQEU9giOEGHABTexCZ9AAOREcHJ/9AWjXKQDA6VILlE4gwiRC/NHlN0/7y+hQ0JstXVu6SJIEQAl2ifKU+kMxrHEc48i3CkEPK139gEfGIELE1Ltcd7rcT5jMXlFKkadodrDo7+D7OfINnvMdytYBljaCqKmzbrr9e3f0JSinL6jhjmOYQE0qgaT0YxgCuO23FGjtkjOWgCb2vgxCCIAhaocYZVo845/A8r55Zcd4FfAM3jhH/wr24HwAAAABJRU5ErkJggg=='); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"a copy and paste key with the stack overflow logo\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/2c5b55e042e34974ddf25a5c8474d1eb/5a190/copy-paste.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/2c5b55e042e34974ddf25a5c8474d1eb/772e8/copy-paste.png 200w,\n/static/2c5b55e042e34974ddf25a5c8474d1eb/e17e5/copy-paste.png 400w,\n/static/2c5b55e042e34974ddf25a5c8474d1eb/5a190/copy-paste.png 800w,\n/static/2c5b55e042e34974ddf25a5c8474d1eb/c1b63/copy-paste.png 1200w,\n/static/2c5b55e042e34974ddf25a5c8474d1eb/29007/copy-paste.png 1600w,\n/static/2c5b55e042e34974ddf25a5c8474d1eb/c3611/copy-paste.png 2992w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>That’s part of the job, but only part.</p>\n<p>The role of the knocker-up is fairly well-defined. It’s … to wake people up.\nThis is different from the role of, say, a hairdresser, who is partly there to cut hair, and partly there to act as a therapist.</p>\n<p>The role of a software developer is similarly blended, except the computer is the one on the therapy couch.\nEven before we start writing code, our job is to understand what problem is being solved,\nunderstand why the original problem statement was flawed, re-define the problem,\nand explore risks.\nThen, after we’ve written (or copy-and-pasted) the code, our job is to\nget code from the internet all the way into production,\ndebug the code, debug the code again,\nunderstand the computer’s deepest secrets, try and stop the computer system from going completely mad, work with colleagues to integrate incompatible systems,\nmanage stakeholders, manage other stakeholders who are quite obstreperous,\ndebug the code again since it’s doing something in production which no one has seen before,\nand then re-define the problem again.</p>\n<p>Fundamentally, our job as software developers is to solve problems which have never been solved before.\nI mean, if the problem had been solved already, why would we want to solve it again?\nLet’s just get a computer to do that for us.</p>\n<h2>Demand is infinite</h2>\n<p>In my experience, software creates the need for … more software.\nThink, for example, of Jenkins, or Tekton. Or Kubernetes. Or, in fact, the whole of the CNCF landscape.\nThese are complex pieces of software which only came into existence because other software existed.\nThink of ad-blockers; their whole existence is a response to other software.</p>\n<p>Software multiplies. Software snowballs.</p>\n<p>The world doesn’t just demand software.

In the end, COBOL didn’t remove the need for developers: instead, it created demand for COBOL developers.”</p>\n<h2>But our jobs will change</h2>\n<p>Even if AI is unlikely to take our jobs, it doesn’t mean it won’t <em>change</em> them.\nWhen a productivity improvement is available, it is expected that people use it.\nNone of us, not even the most curmudgeonly technology-resistant developer, program like it’s 1947.\nIf we did, we wouldn’t have achieved cat videos and <em>Baldur’s Gate</em> and online shopping.\nNone of us are using punch cards, or <code class=\"language-text\">GOTO</code> statements. We use IDEs, and Testcontainers, and Quarkus.\nWe wouldn’t write a greenfield application in COBOL, except as a dare.\nSome hardcore folks use assembler, but only in contexts where being close to the metal is worth the productivity penalty.</p>\n<p>I have some questions about how much the current batch of tools <em>actually</em> improve productivity, but that’s a separate topic.\nI think we can safely assume that some of the quality issues with generative AI will be ironed out.\nThese tools will become embedded in our workflow, just as IDEs and compilers have.\nThey will take away some drudgery and toil, but they will not take the jobs.\nThe computer assistants are coming, but the people aren’t going away.</p>\n<h1>Further reading</h1>\n<p>This topic isn’t going away.

June 10, 2024.</li>\n<li>At GOTO Copenhagen 2024, Kent Beck was asked if AI would end the job of a developer. He had a two-word answer: “Jevon’s Paradox.” In other words, reducing the cost of a thing increases demand for it. This is a simular argument to mine, but I hadn’t thought of linking it to Jevon’s Paradox, even though I actually spend a lot of time thinking about Jevon’s paradox in other contexts.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/ai-tools-for-software-engineers-simon-willison\">AI tools for software engineers, but without the hype</a>, September 25,2024. The inaugural podcast from Gergely Orosz featured Simon Willison, who has been doing a lot of interesting writing and talking about AI. The whole podcast is worth a listen, but there’s a discussion about the impact on jobs towards the end. Simon’s take is that AI won’t replace developer jobs, but developers who don’t become proficient with the tools may become out-competed.</li>\n</ul>","excerpt":"Large language models are astonishingly good at producing large volumes of code quickly.\nThat’s also, sort of, what I do for a living…","fields":{"title":"Will Generative AI Kill Developer Jobs?","slug":"/will-ai-take-our-jobs/","prefix":"2024-03-21","shortDate":"03-21","category":"software-development","author":"holly cummins","displayCategory":"software development","geography":null,"video":null,"slides":null,"oembeds":null,"cover":{"childImageSharp":{"resize":{"src":"/static/89c6ef32242c53496c3293e0b43e0512/630fb/knocker-up.png"}}}},"frontmatter":{"type":"blog","event":null,"keynote":null,"code":null,"resources":null}},"authornote":{"id":"77e0dd69-1df1-59df-9a8e-f3f29c267627","html":"<p><strong>Holly Cummins</strong>.
