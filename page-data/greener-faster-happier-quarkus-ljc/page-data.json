That’s cool, but how does it work? Usually, we expect to\ntrade-off developer experience against runtime efficiency. In this session, Holly will dive into some of the technical\nunderpinnings of Quarkus’s efficiency. She’ll give advice for those using or considering Quarkus - should you be doing\nreactive programming? Do native binaries run fastest? The talk includes some theory (what underpins Quarkus’s surprising\nthroughput?) and also live demos (does Quarkus really start faster than a light bulb? What does an integration testing\nflow with Quarkus look like?)</p>","excerpt":"Quarkus makes both people and hardware more efficient. That’s cool, but how does it work?
