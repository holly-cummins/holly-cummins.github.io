Efficiency is ruining our happiness, and weirdly, it’s also ruining our efficiency. Heeeeelppp!? What’s a techie to do? Zombie servers and slow code are a big climate problem, but the vrrrooom model gives us double-win hope. Holly walks through a range of techniques that can be used to find and eliminate software waste and reduce climate impacts.</p>\n<p>But machine efficiency isn’t much use without human efficiency. Surprisingly, sorting out machine efficiency often helps humans, too. For example, the Quarkus Java framework uses many interesting waste-reduction techniques. These optimisations have the dual benefit of speeding up computers, and also speeding up people.</p>\n<p>So far, so good, but we need to be careful we don’t end up accidentally optimising the wrong things, and making stuff worse. 100% utilisation is not sustainable for either humans, or people. It’s not even very efficient (what!?). Holly gives a brief tour of the brain’s default mode network, the latest business research, and queueing theory, to show why we actually achieve more when we do a bit less.</p>","excerpt":"Inefficiency is ruining our planet and our lives.
