Performance tuning can be very skilled, but the basic principles are straightforward and should be accessible to every Java developer.</p>\n<p>This is the methodology I recommend.</p>\n<p>All performance problems are caused by a limited resource. Your job as a performance analyst (or developer who’s suddenly required to be a performance analyst) is to identify what resource is limited - what’s the bottleneck for this application? Often after fixing the first bottleneck, a second bottleneck will become apparent - the process of performance tuning is the process of eliminating bottlenecks, one by one, until the performance is good enough for you and your stakeholders.</p>\n<p>Computational resources fall into a few basic categories. Different people count them differently, but I like to think of four types of resource: the CPU, memory, I/O, and locks.</p>\n<p>A CPU-bound application can’t get enough processor time to complete its work. A memory-bound application needs more memory than is available. An I/O-bound application is trying to do I/O faster than the system can handle. Finally, a lock-bound application is being held up by the fact that multiple threads are contending on the same locks. ‘Lock-bound’ isn’t a terribly common term, but I think it’s really important to consider lock contention when analyzing performance problems. As systems become more and more parallel, synchronization are increasingly a limiting factor in the scalability of the system.</p>\n<p>So how do you identify which of these resources is the cause of the hold-up? Some heuristics can help as a first step. If the CPU is at or near 100%, the CPU is likely to be the culprit. If the CPU isn’t near 100%, it’s probably locking or I/O. The rule of thumb becomes a bit muddier when it comes to memory. Sometimes memory problems can show up as low CPU usage, because the system is waiting on a heap lock (which is properly locking) or physical memory access - paging in the worst case (technically, I/O). However, in a garbage collected system, excessive memory consumption will often manifest as lots of processing time being spent in the garbage collector (CPU).</p>\n<p>Tools can help turn these fairly fuzzy heuristics into a more precise diagnosis. There are lots of tools available, both free and not-free. My favourite tool is <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/java-health-center-client-low-overhead-monitoring-tool\">IBM’s Health Center</a>. This is probably because I’m the technical lead for the Health Center, so I think what it does is pretty sensible and cool. :) The Health Center is free, but it can only monitor IBM JVMs. I do think it’s one of the best ways to investigate garbage collection, locking, and collect method profiles from an IBM JVM.</p>\n<p>The Health Center tries to automate the process of identifying the root cause of a performance problem. The front page shows a dashboard with a bunch of status indicators. If one of them is red or orange, that’s a pretty good indicator of where to start tweaking the performance. The one area the Health Center doesn’t cover at the moment is I/O. It can identify garbage collection and locking bottlenecks pretty accurately, and the method profiler can identify the root cause of much excessive CPU usage.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 400px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/23fc60c39e6da2cc3940c038d9c77b71/e17e5/healthcenterfrontpage.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 68%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"healthcenterfrontpage\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/23fc60c39e6da2cc3940c038d9c77b71/e17e5/healthcenterfrontpage.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/23fc60c39e6da2cc3940c038d9c77b71/772e8/healthcenterfrontpage.png 200w,\n/static/23fc60c39e6da2cc3940c038d9c77b71/e17e5/healthcenterfrontpage.png 400w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>So let’s say you’ve used the Health Center (or your tool of choice) and you’re seeing some red crosses.

In later posts I’ll give a bit more background about how to go about fixing locking issues, memory issues, and CPU issues.</p>\n<p>Forward links:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/how-interpre-method-profile/\">How to interpret a method profile</a></li>\n</ul>","excerpt":"I was talking to a friend today about a performance problem he was seeing, and he explained that he wasn’t entirely sure how to fix it…","fields":{"title":"How do you solve a performance problem?","slug":"/how-do-you-solve-performance-problem/","prefix":"2009-05-11","shortDate":"05-11","category":"java","author":"holly cummins","displayCategory":"java","geography":null,"video":null,"slides":null,"oembeds":null,"cover":{"childImageSharp":{"resize":{"src":"/static/8f23dfb25b5a001ff5e1775c58bc7318/9dc27/amirali-mirhashemian-5TEN19lBTBI-unsplash.jpg"}}}},"frontmatter":{"type":"blog","event":null,"keynote":null,"code":null,"resources":null}},"authornote":{"id":"77e0dd69-1df1-59df-9a8e-f3f29c267627","html":"<p><strong>Holly Cummins</strong>.
