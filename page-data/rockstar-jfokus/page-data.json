Along the way, a lot was learned about eighties music, classloaders, parsing, bytecode manipulation, and the important relationship between language style, syntax, and semantics.</p>\n<p>There will be live coding, live singing and live guitar!</p>","excerpt":"Let’s run Rockstar programs on Quarkus!
