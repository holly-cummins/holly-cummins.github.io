Holly Cummins is a Senior Principal Software Engineer on the Red Hat Quarkus team.
Before joining Red Hat, Holly was a long time IBMer.
In her time at IBM, Holly has been a full-stack javascript developer, a WebSphere Liberty build architect, a client-facing consultant in the IBM Garage, a JVM performance engineer, and an innovation leader.
Holly led the developer community in the IBM Garage for several years and became a bit of a methods geek.
During her time in the IBM Garage, Holly led projects for enormous banks, tiny startups, and everything in between.
Holly has used the power of cloud to understand climate risks, count fish, help a blind athlete run ultra-marathons in the desert solo, and invent stories (although not at all the same time).
Holly is also an Oracle Java Champion, IBM Q Ambassador, and JavaOne Rock Star. Before joining the IBM Garage, she was Delivery Lead for the WebSphere Liberty Profile (now Open Liberty).
Holly co-authored Manningâ€™s _Enterprise OSGi in Action_ and is a regular keynote speaker.
She has spoken at KubeCon (keynote), GOTO, JavaOne, Devoxx, Sonar+D, JavaZone, JFokus, The ServerSide Java Symposium, GOTO, JAX London, QCon, GeeCon, and the Great Indian Developer Summit, as well as a number of user groups.
