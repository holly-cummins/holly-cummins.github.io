Last week was a big week for the Health Center team. Version 1.0 of the Health Center was released. Full installation instructions are available from the [Health Center homepage](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/mon-diag-tools?topic=monitoring-diagnostic-tools-health-center). It now works with IBM Support Assistant and is suitable for use in production (with recent IBM JVMs). A method profiler that's got a low enough overhead to be used in production and left on all the time is a pretty special thing, I think. One which is only part of a tool which also assesses system stability, triages a range of performance problems, and makes performance tuning accessible to non-experts is even more special, I think.

To celebrate the whole team baked and brought in carrot cake, brownies, chocolate chip cookies, lemon cake, rocky road squares, and flapjacks. We even had balloons. It was very nice but I've never eaten so much at work and I think we were all ready to explode by the afternoon - in future I think we should delegate and have only half the team bake per release.
