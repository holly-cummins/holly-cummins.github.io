For this 100th episode of Environment Variables from the Green Software Foundation, guest host Anne Currie is joined by Holly Cummins, senior principal engineer at Red Hat, to discuss the intersection of AI, efficiency, and sustainable software practices. They explore the concept of "Lightswitch Ops"—designing systems that can easily be turned off and on to reduce waste—and the importance of eliminating zombie servers. They cover AI’s growing energy demands, the role of optimization in software sustainability, and Microsoft's new shift in cloud investments. They also touch on AI regulation and the evolving strategies for balancing performance, cost, and environmental impact in tech.
