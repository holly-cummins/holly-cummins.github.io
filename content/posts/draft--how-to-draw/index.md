I've never been particularly artistic. As a kid, like all young children, I liked drawing.
At some point, though, probably once I started having art class in school, it became obvious to me _I wasn't very good at it_.
My more talented peers were producing beautiful pictures, and clumsy me was drawing lumpy figures that only barely looked human.
Luckily, I knew the solution. I gave up. I stopped even trying, because if I wasn't trying, I couldn't fail. I never drew in my spare time, and as soon as art classes weren't compulsory, I dropped them. Instead,
I focussed on the things I knew I was good at (science, math, English ... definitely nothing that required hand-eye coordination).

I didn't miss the drawing I wasn't doing until a few years ago. I started doing more conference speaking, and I needed _lots of pictures_. 
It's well known that visuals make talks more enjoyable for the audience. Well-chosen visuals can actually make talks more effective, too – reinforcing a message
across both visual and verbal channels makes it [sink in more](https://www.shiftelearning.com/blog/bid/350326/studies-confirm-the-power-of-visuals-in-elearning). People remember visual messages better than they do verbal-only ones, a phenomenon known as the [picture superiority effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picture_superiority_effect). Part of the reason for this images are a 'native format' for our brain's memory, just like words ([dual coding theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual-coding_theory)).

Like many other presenters, I used photographs in my presentations. But the right photograph can be hard to find, and [copyright predators](https://doctorow.medium.com/a-bug-in-early-creative-commons-licenses-has-enabled-a-new-breed-of-superpredator-5f6360713299) are an increasing concern.
Some concepts couldn't be expressed in stock photos.
I tried [taking my own photographs](https://noti.st/holly-cummins/iNasA3/everything-i-know-about-software-i-learnt-from-spaghetti-bolognese), but the quality wasn't great. It turns out photography is a skill.
I was also conscious that when I used photos, even if the photos were _good_ photos, my presentations looked exactly like everyone else's.

So ten years ago, I tried drawing my own slides. I was drawing at about the level I had when I gave up on art, in primary school.
Nonetheless, I was impressed at how flexible sketches were for communicating technical ideas:

Even with my clumsy drawings, I was also able to express emotion. And drawings lent themselves to animations which built up a story in a way photos didn't:

Here's what I learned:

## Difference is good

If a presentation looks exactly the same as six other presentations a conference-goer has seen that 
day, it's unlikely to be memorable. If it looks exactly the same as the presentations they were seeing 
five years ago, that's probably worse. There's a lot to be said for palate cleansing, 
interest, and freshness. 


## Competence is over-rated

talk about kids, always good, don't know how to fail

Sometimes the best conference talks are from people learning an area - is that relevant?

Kasia better than me

There are two kinds of incompetence. One is the humble-brag

The other is "no really, this is unrecognisable." I was pleased with a drawing I did of someone
cuddling a cloud, so I put it in my email signature. I took it back out again after the
third person asked me why I had a picture of someone holding a large loaf of bread.

## Tracing

How can I draw complex shapes? I cheat. I hate to say 'fake it 'til you make it', but this is basically that. I trace. If I'm drawing something beyond my skill (a horse, a cat, something with perspective ... well, if I'm honest, almost anything), I find a suitable photo to use as a base.(This is something digital drawing tools make _very_ easy.)
If a single photo isn't enough, I'll patch a few photos together.

Tracing helps me with the basic shapes and proportions, but

## Practice

_This drawing of a burger was traced, but even with that qualification I'm still pleased with it.
I think I did a good job with the texture and reflection on the bun._

## Experiment

Experimentation is a key part of continuous improvement. 
Over the years, I've tried many different styles of drawing – with shading, flat, monochrome,
bold lines, fine sketchy lines ...

I loved how my [Kubecon keynote](TODO link) came out

Some of them haven't even involved drawing – for example, I like how slides come out if 
I just use some super-sized icons from the [noun project](TODO link).

TODO find the deck? snf.

For some things, my drawing skill just isn't enough. Rather than going all the way 
back to photos, I've had good experiences with a [hybrid style](TODO cloud chaos link). 
I think it's more expressive than either photos of drawings alone.

There's also an energy that comes from the tension between the two media.

## Observing

abstracted style with rough edges and few details, so it's hard to get wrong.

## Lessons

I assumed drawing was an innate talent, but it can be taught.
There are lots of super resources out there, and one of the 
things on my todo list is to explore them more. For the moment, 
I've got lots out of 'how to draw' videos aimed at young kids (they're about the right level!).
My favourite is [Art For Kids hub](https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/artforkidshub).

# The mechanics 

People sometimes ask me about my drawing process, so here are some details. 
I started out drawing on paper, with sharpies, and then using a scanner to digitise them. 
It worked, but it was labour-intensive, and I could only do it at home. Eventually 
phone cameras got good enough I could use them instead of a scanner, so I could edit 
 talks in a hotel room. 
 
![An architecture diagram](sharpie-architecture.png)
_An example drawing done with Sharpie on paper, 2015_
 
I saw Marlena Compton do some amazing sketching using the Paper stylus and an iPad app, 
so I switched to digital. 
(Marlena can even give a talks by live-drawing them, which is something I've never been brave enough to attempt.)
Going digital meant I could trace, and also 
experiment with different brushes and 'pens' beyond just sharpies.

_An drawing using the Paper app and stylus, 2016_

However, the first app I used was more targeted for note-taking, 
so my drawings were disappointingly pixelated on a big screen. 

![A closeup of the matchbox picture](matchbox-pixels)
_Look at all those pixels on the diagonal lines_

When the iPad Pro and Pencil came out, I switched and haven't looked back. 
Even though I only use a fraction of the power of my drawing app, 
tracing is easier, I can use layers for animations, I can shade ... 
I use [Tayasui Sketches Pro](TODO link). I like it, but I haven't evaluated it against other apps.

![A drawing of a sheep in wolf's clothing](sheep-in-wolfs-clothing.png)
_I drew this in 2022. I had help on the shape of the sheep but added the wolf. 
I was able to use shading and stippling to make the fur on these 
animals a bit more furry_


I have found, however, that sketchnoting in meetings is powerful, even if the note-taker (me!) can't draw well. Visual note-taking works especially well for complex concepts or new domains, so it was an ideal technique when potential customers were briefing the IBM Garage on their challenges. It makes people feel like they're _really_ being heard to see their words turned into pictures as they speak. My colleague Jocelyne Dittmer has done an [excellent guide to getting started drawing in public](https://medium.com/@jocelynedittmer_5269/visual-thinking-sketching-ec64f19cf70).
