Get asked, just did it, not helpful

Older than manager in first job, watched people get promoted past me - doing ok but also old

Do know that did wrong

Sticking with same area too long sunk cost fallacy

Not bringing people with me

Being smartest person in room - brag? No, mistake - it’s the wrong room, not learning … or you’re not seeing what other people have to offer

Overload - how fix?!

Not moving the needle, small useful things

(Beagle auto correct :) )

# Do not be a hero

A mentor gave me this advice, and it was a hard lesson. Who doesn't want to be a hero? When people tell you you're indispensible, it feels _good_. When you're indispensible, it protects you from being moved out. But it also prevents you from being moved _up_. But it feels so good to be useful. 

Not understanding assessment criteria, what will make your manger look good?

Is a blessing if things get so bad, it pushes you to move, career blog , the not getting promoted, and the removed from talent list we don’t see you having ambition
