I was trying to understand the figures, so I asked "why does this one use less carbon?" The answer? "Because it's faster."


This is, initially, counter-intuitive. For something like buying a car, there are hard choices.
Should we get the muscley one with the bigger engine that goes vrrroooom, or should we get the economical one 
that preserves fuel and goes put-put-put?

"Performance is the art of avoiding work" - Stale Pederson
The car is faster because it uses more resources. Quarkus is faster because it's more efficient.

Of course, there's always a trade-off. With Quarkus, there is a trade-off, but it's not the tradeoff I expected. 
When running on JVM, Quarkus uses about half the memory footprint of a traditional cloud native framework, and starts about four times faster. 

Counter-intuitive.

"Finer-grained conditional builds" 
Shorter, smarter, builds does seem like it would be such a massive win, doesn't it? So much compute power is wasted on compiling things that didn't change and then running tests that aren't interesting ... all while slowing down the feedback cycle for engineers.

   I'm learning the decades-long message that "we must sacrifice our lifestyle to save the planet" is wrong:
   - EV's are better
   - walkable cities with clean air are better
   - induction cooking & heat pumps are better
   What needs to be done is not sacrifice - it's advancement"](foley-tweet.png)](https://twitter.com/GlobalEcoGuy/status/1549989438142517248?s=20&t=RHDNuiSmnr6oGhQsW15eQw)
