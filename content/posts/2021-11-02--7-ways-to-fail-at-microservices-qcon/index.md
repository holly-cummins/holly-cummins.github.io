We all know the promise of microservices - organisational, agility, decoupling, pizza lunches, autonomy, fewer meetings. Some organisations actually achieve this. Others … don’t.
It turns out dividing an application up across multiple containers isn’t enough. Distributed is not a synonym for decoupled. A decomposed application may just be a health hazard. Cloud native spaghetti isn’t something you want. Continuous deployment doesn’t mean ‘every six months’. And have you spoken to your release board and QA team about all this?
