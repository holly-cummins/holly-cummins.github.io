How do you give a great talk?
It's a question I'm occasionally asked, but not one I've ever properly answered.
There are two reasons for this.

The first reason is fear. If I write down advice about giving talks, that means I'd be positioning myself as some kind
of public speaking *expert*, and who do I think I am?
I'm afraid any attempt at giving advice would come across as arrogant, or over-confident, or even totally lacking in
self-awareness about my own limitations as a speaker.

The second reason I don't create a set of public speaking tips is that *I've already done it*. I'm busy, I don't want to
do it again!

Many years ago, I wrote a talk about giving talks.
I have a photo of the talk being given, but I lost the talk itself in a job move.
In my mind, this one-off talk has grown to be the perfect set of advice about
Maybe if I wait long enough, the lost slides will somehow emerge from the digital depths? (They won't. I've looked, and
they're gone.)

# It's about the audience, not you

See above, about "it's not about me".

## Have a point and a purpose

I have to confess, I struggle with this one. I like putting ideas together and finding connections, but the purpose of a
talk isn't an intellectual for me.
The purpose of a talk is to make the audience's life better, or to make the world better, or, ideally, both.
What do I want to my different at the end of this talk?
What do I want people to leave and do differently?

### Three takeaways

Because I'm so bad at having a point and self-editing, I've started doing takeaway slides as my last slide.
This forces me to think about what I really want the audience to remember and focus on that.
So it's good for me, but it's also good for the audience as a way of reinforcing things.

# Every slide should be a gift

You give a talk, you don't impose a talk.

The slides have two purposes; as a prompt to help you remember what you want to say, and to help the audience follow
you, and also entertain ??

# Stories

"Include stories" is standard public speaking advice.
I heartily endorse this. We learn through stories.
Stories make us pay attention, stories make us remember. In the age of AI, stories have another benefit â€“ they're
uniquely ours.

Sometimes, speakers take the advice very literally, and insert a well-telegraphed "story" section into their talk.
I have seen this work well, but I'd be cautious with it.
You could include a story in your talk, but it's even better to include *many* stories in your talk, and to weave them
organically in amongst the other content.

But what if you don't have the right story?

One option is to use a fictional story instead, but I'd be cautious.
It is certainly possible to learn from allegories, but a made-up story won't have the same impact as something that
actually happened.

## Seek out stories

Some years ago, I was at a work event in Las Vegas.
We had to walk up and down the strip to get everywhere, which meant walking past people trying to coax us into unsavoury
bars.
At one of them, the greeter-coaxer-seller (what *is* the right word for that job?) looked at us and decided that since
we were clearly work-colleagues, and his establishment was not even remotely safe for work, getting us through the door
was going to be tough.
He brought out the biggest selling point he had: "think of the *stories* you'll have to tell."
(You'll be glad to hear that it did not work, as none of us wanted to come home from our work trip with exciting stories
about strip bars.)

While stories about strip bars are almost always the wrong kind of story, I think the greeter-coaxer-seller had a good
point.
Sometimes, the best way to get good stories is to _make them happen_.
As a consultant, I've deliberately bid low on projects, because I knew they'd make a great story for my team.

## Harvest stories

Sometimes, you don't find the story, the story finds you.
A better option is to harvest stories.

## Current pain is a future story

this is going to make a great story

Haha. Yeah, I explain at the beginning that @Stuart Douglas taught me to put cute kittens in talks as a sort of penance
to make sure people would remember something positive after a hard explanation. So after every trick explained, there's
a cute fox kit, and I encourage the audience to make an "awwwww" sound. It is a nice trick to make sure they wake up
too :joy:

Each slide should be a gift for the audience. Sometimes that's not possible, so give an extra gift.
The cute slides serve three purposes: section markers, rewards, and a trigger for audience interaction.

## Enjoy it

One of the best pieces of speaking advice I ever got was to smile.
Don't smile so much that you look deranged, but do smile.

When I'm enjoying myself, the audience tends to enjoy themselves.
