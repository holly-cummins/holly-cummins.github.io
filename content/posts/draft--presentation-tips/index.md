Haha. Yeah, I explain at the beginning that @Stuart Douglas taught me to put cute kittens in talks as a sort of penance to make sure people would remember something positive after a hard explanation. So after every trick explained, there's a cute fox kit, and I encourage the audience to make an "awwwww" sound. It is a nice trick to make sure they wake up too :joy:

Each slide should be a gift for the audience. Sometimes that's not possible, so give an extra gift.
The cute slides serve three purposes: section markers, rewards, and a trigger for audience interaction.

## Enjoy it

When I'm enjoying myself, the audience tends to enjoy themselves.
