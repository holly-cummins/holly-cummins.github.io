Quarkus was created to enable Java developers to deliver applications for a modern, cloud-native world. A Kubernetes-native Java framework, Quarkus is tailored for the Java VM and GraalVM native image, and crafted from best-of-breed Java libraries and standards. Join us as we explore the technical capabilities, critical use cases, and benefits that make Quarkus ideal for Kubernetes and serverless environments while offering developers a framework to address a wider range of distributed application architectures. Weâ€™ll even throw in a demonstration of Quarkus in action.
