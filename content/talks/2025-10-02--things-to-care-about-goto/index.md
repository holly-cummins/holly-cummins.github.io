Development is about working with computers, right? Well, not quite. Development is all about working with computers (
easy), and working with people (hard). Oh, and it’s about physics. Things like the speed of light and thermodynamics
influence APIs, because they influence hardware and networking. If, like Holly, you slept through statistics modules in
university, it will be a surprise to discover how statistics has changed our development workflows. Finally, we mustn’t
forget economics. The end of zero-interest-rates has changed the employment landscape for many of us. In this
wide-ranging talk, Holly will cover why the end of Moore’s law means we might finally need to get to grips with
concurrent programming, why is Loom a good idea now when green threads were a bad idea, why is AOT a good idea now when
it used to be a bad idea, and how much you should care about business studies, finance, and statistics.
