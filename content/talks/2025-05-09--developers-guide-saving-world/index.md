None of us actually like waste, but many of us tolerate it. This is a shame, because waste is really really bad.
It makes our software more expensive to develop, and more expensive to run. It contributes to climate change. It means
sometimes, people who’d like to use our software, can’t. It slows us down.

In this talk, Holly will present a range of practical waste-reduction techniques, including:

- LightSwitchOps
- Moving computational work to where it hurts least
- Measuring the right thing, instead of measuring the wrong thing (harder than it seems!)
- Performance profiling basics
- Doing less
