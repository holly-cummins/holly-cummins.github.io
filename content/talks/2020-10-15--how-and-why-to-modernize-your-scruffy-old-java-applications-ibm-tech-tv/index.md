Once upon a time, that application was great - it was built using the latest technology, it was easy to understand, users loved it. Now, not so much. It’s grown and looking a bit … unwieldy monolithic. We’ll discuss when to modernise, when to leave well enough alone, and what you need to know before you microservice. Automation and testing are important parts of a modern app, so we will demo how the Pact contract testing framework can save effort, improve flow, & protect against regressions.
