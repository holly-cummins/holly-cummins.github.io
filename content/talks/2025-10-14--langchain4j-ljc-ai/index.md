AI isn't just for coding assistants and python programmers.
The real power of LLMs comes from integrating them into applications, connected to real data and real business logic.
LangChain4j is emerging as a de facto standard for LLM integration in Java.
In this demo-driven talk, Holly will explore a range of cool LangChain4j capabilities, such
as type safe object mapping, stateful context, agents, RAG, guard rails, and fault tolerance.
(The demos will use Quarkus, but LangChain4j can be used with any framework.)
