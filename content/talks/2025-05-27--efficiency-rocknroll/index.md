Is efficiency rock and roll? You might think the answer is “no, definitely not, no way.” Efficiency is about doing more with less, and rock n’ roll is all about turning it up to eleven and doing more with more. Efficiency is about being responsible, and rock n’ roll is about being irresponsible. But wait! High overheads are not rock n roll, and they’re not efficient. Spending time on boring tasks is neither rock n roll, nor efficient. We’re spending way too much time writing and running code that doesn’t spark joy. In this talk, Holly will discuss practical patterns for wringing maximum value out of our code, for minimum effort. One of the techniques is sleeping! It turns out, both people and computers should be lazier, and that’s definitely rock n roll.
