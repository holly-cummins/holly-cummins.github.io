The innovation fizzle, the fauxnnovation, the maximal viable product. Holly’s seen them all. 
 In a world where there’s always too much to do and too little time, how can organisations make time to innovate?

 A presentation on practical innovation strategy, exploring how to design an MVP, how to get something for nothing, and psychological safety.
