Not so long ago, we interacted with websites by clicking buttons, and with people by talking to them. Those lines, however, are becoming increasingly blurred, with real people guiding our website interactions and computers running phone, Twitter, and Facebook Messenger interactions. An increasing number of these interactions are voice, rather than text, ones. What does it all mean? Are websites obsolete, or is this a passing fad? Is chatbottery the new HMTL, only without the standardization? This session presents a practical introduction to how chatbots work, their advantages, their limitations, and where they should and should not be used.
