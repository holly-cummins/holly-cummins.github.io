Everyone’s talking about innovation, but how do you know if you’re actually doing it? What are the ingredients for successful innovation? In this talk, Holly will describe how the right combination of people, place, practices, and platform can lead to some pretty impressive outcomes. She’ll also answer questions, such as ‘what happens when we think about our user first?’, ‘is there an app for that?’, ’can a computer really tell dog breeds apart?,’ how can I tell if my idea is great or terrible?’, ’how long does it take to build a minimum viable product?’
