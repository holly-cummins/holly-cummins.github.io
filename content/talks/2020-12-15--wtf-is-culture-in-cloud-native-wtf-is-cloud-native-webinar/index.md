In this WTFinar, Holly Cummins, Worldwide Development Leader at IBM Garage, discussed these and other pressing questions (WTFs and others) about Cloud Native and the culture you need to make it truly work for your organisation.
She was joined by Container Solutions CEO Jamie Dobson, who served a tasty, healthy helping of industry gossip while learning about the other stuff. (Come for the goss, stay for the insights).
