Computers are getting small enough and cheap enough that they’re almost disposable. It’s possible to sock computers away almost anywhere, and to connect almost anything to the internet. At the same time, the Java stacks that we know and love are also getting lighter and cheaper. That combination means it’s possible to put a full spec-compliant Java EE server on ridiculously cheap hardware, and then throw it around the room without worrying too much about breaking stuff.
