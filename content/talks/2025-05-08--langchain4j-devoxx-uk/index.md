Join us for a guided tour through the possibilities of the LangChain4j framework! Chat with virtually any LLM provider (
OpenAI, Gemini, HuggingFace, Azure, AWS, ...)? Generate AI images straight from your Java application with Dall-E and
Gemini? Have LLMs return POJOs? Interact with local models on your machine? LangChain4j makes it a piece of cake! We
will explain the fundamental building blocks of LLM-powered applications, show you how to chain them together into AI
Services, and how to interact with your knowledge base using advanced RAG.

Then, we take a deeper dive into the Quarkus LangChain4j integration. We'll show how little code is needed when using
Quarkus, how live reload makes experimenting with prompts a breeze and finally we'll look at its native image generation
capabilities, aiming to get your AI-powered app deployment-ready in no time. By the end of this session, you will have
all the technical knowledge to get your hands dirty, along with plenty of inspiration for designing the apps of the
future.
