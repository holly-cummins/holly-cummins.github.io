Ever been told “work is not a place to be happy?” It’s not true! As developers, our job is to be productive, and we’re
most productive when we’re in flow, doing friction-free creation. How do we embrace the happiness paradigm, without
throwing out the old ones we also need, such as efficiency and safety? In this talk, Holly will explain how our industry
is changing, and present a number of productivity tips for the lazy, happy, developer.
