Do I need an extension? And how do I write it?

Extensions are a great way of enabling your favourite library to fully take advantage of Quarkus’s capabilities. They can also be used to improve your team’s everyday workflow.

In this talk Georgios and Holly will talk through how extensions can be useful, before live-coding a simple extension. (What it does is a surprise!)
