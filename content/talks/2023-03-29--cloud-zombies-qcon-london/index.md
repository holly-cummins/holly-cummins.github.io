Wait, zombies? Really? Zombies are servers which aren’t doing useful work. They’re everywhere, costing money, eating electricity, and belching carbon. And they’re useless! So how do we get rid of them? In this talk, Holly will explain how utilisation and elasticity relate to sustainability. She will also introduce a range of practical zombie-hunting techniques, including absurdly-simple-automation, LightSwitchOps, and FinOps.
