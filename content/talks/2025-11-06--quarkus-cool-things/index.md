1. Save the world.
2. Lightning-quick CLIs.
3. Embed WASM.
4. Run Spring code.
5. AI, for real.
   5½. Use Minecraft as an observability client. Ok, this one isn’t cool, it’s stupid, but Holly’s
   done it anyway.

In this demo-driven session, Holly will show some of her favorite Quarkus capabilities. Some are established and
important, some are less well-known, and some are plain silly. But they’re all cool. Whether you’re new to Quarkus or an
experienced user, you’ll discover something you didn’t know.
