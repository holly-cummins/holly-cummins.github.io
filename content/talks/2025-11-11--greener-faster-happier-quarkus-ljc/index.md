Quarkus makes both people and hardware more efficient. That’s cool, but how does it work? Usually, we expect to
trade-off developer experience against runtime efficiency. In this session, Holly will dive into some of the technical
underpinnings of Quarkus’s efficiency. She’ll give advice for those using or considering Quarkus - should you be doing
reactive programming? Do native binaries run fastest? The talk includes some theory (what underpins Quarkus’s surprising
throughput?) and also live demos (does Quarkus really start faster than a light bulb? What does an integration testing
flow with Quarkus look like?)
