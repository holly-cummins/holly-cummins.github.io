Cloud native – the perfect recipe for innovation, adaptability, and engineering excellence. Right? Well, when it goes right. When it goes wrong, sometimes it’s monster spaghetti, sometimes it’s a quality headache, and – worst of all – sometimes it’s exactly as clunky and slow-to-change as what it’s replacing. As a consultant, Holly gets to see really good practices and also the anti-patterns; in this talk, she’ll share stories of what happens when things go wrong.
