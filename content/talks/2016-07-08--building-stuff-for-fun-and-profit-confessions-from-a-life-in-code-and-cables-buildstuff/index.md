I love making stuff. I’m so happy that my job allows me to make stuff, and when I’m not at work, I’m making stuff anyway. Some of the stuff I’ve made has solved real technical and business problems; some of it I’ve done just to see if I can. In this talk I’ll describe some of the valuable things I’ve built for my employer, IBM, and our clients - I’ll also describe some of the ridiculous things I’ve made for myself. 
These are slides for a talk given at BuildStuff Odessa, 2016 (http://www.buildstuff.com.ua/odessa/)
