Ever been told “work is not a place to be happy?” It’s not true! As developers, our job is to be productive, and we’re most productive when we’re in flow, doing friction-free creation. The good news is that new technologies help us do more, with less effort. (And only some of them are LLMs.) These developer tools and frameworks make us productive, and they bring joy. In this talk, Holly will present a number of productivity tips for the lazy, happy, developer.
