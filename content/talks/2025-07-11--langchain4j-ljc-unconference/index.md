If youâ€™re not experimenting with AI, were you even developing in 2025? LangChain4j is emerging as a de facto standard
for LLM integration in Java. In this demo-driven talk, Holly will explore a range of cool LangChain4j capabilities, such
as type safe object mapping, stateful context, agents, RAG, guard rails, and fault tolerance.
